# AI Learning Journey

This repository documents my practical journey in **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**, with a focus on building real, end-to-end projects and understanding model behavior, evaluation, and interpretability.

## Goals
- Build hands-on ML and DL projects from scratch  
- Practice the full ML pipeline (data → model → evaluation)  
- Develop a portfolio for **AI / ML working student roles**  
- Connect theoretical coursework (ML/DL) with practical implementation

## Projects

### 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning)
**Folder:** `titanic/`

A complete machine learning project using the Titanic dataset, covering data analysis, model training, evaluation, and interpretability.

**Key steps:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and comparison
- Proper evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Feature importance analysis (Explainable AI)

**Models used:**
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (tree-based ensemble)

**Results:**
- Logistic Regression accuracy: **~81%**
- Random Forest accuracy: **~80%**
- Most important features: **Fare, Sex, Age**

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- scikit-learn
- Model evaluation & interpretation
- Structured project documentation
